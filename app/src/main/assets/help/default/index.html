<h2>OpenVPN Connect Android FAQ</h2>

<p>Last update: 2017-12-21 05:22</p>


<h3><i>Q: I am getting the error "MbedTLS: error parsing cert certificate : X509 - The date tag or value is invalid"</i></h3>

<p>This is not a bug in OpenVPN or mbedTLS/MbedTLS but is actually caused by incorrectly formatted certificates.
See this detailed <a href="https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=21873">forum post</a> for more info.</p>

<h3><i>Q: I am getting the error "Client exception in transport_recv_excode: MbedTLS: SSL read error : SSL - Processing of the ServerKeyExchange handshake message failed".</i></h3>

<p>This may be related to using older versions of OpenVPN/OpenSSL on the server side.  Some users have solved this issue by updating their OpenVPN server-side software and/or OpenSSL.</p>

<h3><i>Q: I cannot connect to the server (client times out), and the server log file shows "TLS_ERROR: BIO read tls_read_plaintext error: error:1408A0C1:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_CLIENT_HELLO:no shared cipher".</i></h3>

<p>This is usually remedied by going to the
OpenVPN Preferences menu
and selecting "Force AES-CBC ciphersuites".</p>

<h3><i>Q: I am getting the error "digest_error: NONE: not usable"</i></h3>

<p>This can occur if you specify <b>auth none</b> and also <b>tls-auth</b>
in your client profile.  This occurs because <b>tls-auth</b> needs an auth digest,
but none was specified. There's a straightforward fix: just remove the <b>tls-auth</b> directive,
since it can't be enabled anyway unless you have a non-none <b>auth</b> directive.</p>



<h3><i>Q: How to get started?</i></h3>

<p>A: To use this app, you must have an OpenVPN profile and a server to connect to.
OpenVPN profiles are files that have an extension of <b>.ovpn</b></p>

<p>There are several methods available to import a profile:</p>

<ul>

<li>If you have a .ovpn profile, copy the profile and any files it references to the SD card
folder on your device (copy all files to the same folder).
Then go to Menu / Import / Import Profile from SD card.</li>

<li>If you have an account on an OpenVPN Access Server, you can import the profile
directly from the Access Server by going to Menu / Import / Import Access Server Profile.</li>

<li>If you have an account on the Private Tunnel service, go to Menu / Import / Import
Private Tunnel Profile.</li>

</ul>




<h3><i>Q: Is OpenVPN Connect for Android vulnerable to Heartbleed?</i></h3>

<p>A: No, all versions of OpenVPN Connect for Android use the MbedTLS library,
which is immune to Heartbleed.</p>

<h3><i>Q: Are CRLs (certificate revocation lists) supported?</i></h3>

<p>A: Yes, CRLs are supported starting with version
1.1.14
for Android.</p>

<p>To use a CRL, it must be added to the .ovpn profile, such as:</p>

<blockquote><tt>
&lt;crl-verify&gt;<br>
-----BEGIN X509 CRL-----<br>
MIHxMFwwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEEBQAwFTETMBEGA1UEAxMKT3BlblZQTiBDQRcNMTQw<br>
NDIyMDQzOTI3WhcNMjQwNDE5MDQzOTI3WjAWMBQCAQEYDzIwMTQwNDIyMDQzOTI3<br>
WjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQQFAAOBgQBQXzbNjXkx8+/TeG8qbFQD5wd6wOTe8HnypQTt<br>
eELsI7eyNtiRRhJD3qKfawPVUabSijnwhAPHfhoIOLKe67RLfzOwAsFKPNJAVdmq<br>
rYw1t2eucHvGjH8PnTh0aJPJaI67jmNbSI4CnHNcRgZ+1ow1GS+RAK7kotS+dZz9<br>
0tc7Qw==<br>
-----END X509 CRL-----<br>
&lt;/crl-verify&gt;<br>
</tt></blockquote>

<p>Multiple CRLs may be concatenated together within the <b>crl-verify</b> block above.</p>

<p>If you are importing a .ovpn file
that references an external CRL file such as</p>
<blockquote><tt>
crl-verify crl.pem
</tt></blockquote>
<p>make sure to drop the file <b>crl.pem</b> into the same
place as the .ovpn file during import, so the profile parser can
access it.</p>

<h3><i>Q: I am having trouble importing my .ovpn file.</i></h3>

<p>A: Here are some basic pointers for importing .ovpn files:</p>

<ul>


<li><p>When you import a .ovpn file, make sure that all files referenced by the
.ovpn file such as <b>ca</b>, <b>cert</b>, and <b>key</b> files are in the
same directory on the device as the .ovpn file.</p></li>


<li><p>Profiles must be UTF-8 (or ASCII) and under 256 KB in size.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider using the <b>unified</b> format for OpenVPN profiles
which allows all certs and keys to be embedded into the .ovpn file.  This eases
management of the OpenVPN configuration because it integrates all elements of the
configuration into a single file.</p>

<p>For example, a traditional OpenVPN profile might specify certs
and keys as follows:</p>

<blockquote><tt>
ca ca.crt<br>
cert client.crt<br>
key client.key<br>
tls-auth ta.key 1<br>
</tt></blockquote>

<p>You can convert this usage to <b>unified form</b> by pasting the content
of the certificate and key files directly into the OpenVPN profile as follows
using an XML-like syntax:</p>

<blockquote><tt>
<b>&lt;ca&gt;</b><br>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<br>
MIIBszCCARygAwIBAgIE...<br>
. . .<br>
/NygscQs1bxBSZ0X3KRk...<br>
Lq9iNBNgWg==<br>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----<br>
<b>&lt;/ca&gt;</b><br>
<br>
<b>&lt;cert&gt;</b><br>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----<br>
. . .<br>
<b>&lt;/cert&gt;</b><br>
<br>
<b>&lt;key&gt;</b><br>
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----<br>
. . .<br>
<b>&lt;/key&gt;</b><br>
<br>
<b>key-direction 1</b><br>
<b>&lt;tls-auth&gt;</b><br>
-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----<br>
. . .<br>
<b>&lt;/tls-auth&gt;</b><br>
</tt></blockquote>

<p>Another approach to eliminate certificates and keys from the OpenVPN profile
is to use the Android Keychain as described below.</p> 

<p>NOTE: when converting <b>tls-auth</b> to unified format, check if there is a second
parameter after the filename (usually a 0 or 1).  This parameter is known as the
<b>key-direction</b> parameter and must be specified as a standalone directive when
<b>tls-auth</b> is converted to unified format.  For example if the parameter is 1,
add this line to the profile:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>
key-direction 1
</b></tt></blockquote>

<p>If there is no second parameter to <b>tls-auth</b>, you must add this line to the profile:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>
key-direction bidirectional
</b></tt></blockquote>

</li>
</ul>


<h3><i>Q: Where are the support forums for OpenVPN Connect?</i></h3>

<p>A: <a href="https://forums.openvpn.net/">https://forums.openvpn.net/</a></p>

<h3><i>Q: Is IPv6 supported?</i></h3>

<p>A: Yes.  The OpenVPN app supports IPv6 transport and IPv6 tunnels as long as the
server supports them as well.</p>



<h3><i>Q: Why does OpenVPN Connect show two notification icons when connected?</i></h3>

<p>A: This is something Android requires to affirm that the VPN
session is high priority and should not be arbitrarily terminated by the system.</p>

<h3><i>Q: Can I disable the connection notification sound?</i></h3>

<p>A: On some Android devices, a connection notification sound is played by
Android whenever a VPN tunnel is established, and cannot be silenced by
a non-root app.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to reduce the frequency of these notifications
by going to the Preferences menu and selecting the <b>Seamless Tunnel</b>
option.</p>

<h3><i>Q: How can I maximize battery life?</i></h3>

<p>A: Consider selecting the <b>Battery Saver</b> option in the Preferences menu to Pause the
VPN when the device screen is blanked.  This will cause the VPN to disconnect when the screen
is blanked and automatically reconnect when the screen becomes visible again.  While this
option can extend battery life, it should not be used if you have apps running in the background
that require continuous access to the internet via the VPN (such as a new email notifier).</p>

<p>Note that if you select both the <b>Battery Saver</b> and <b>Seamless Tunnel</b> options,
you will block any app from reaching the internet while the VPN is active but the
device screen is blanked.  This can be useful for additional energy savings, as long
as you don't have any background apps that need constant internet access.</p>

<h3><i>Q: Can I control the VPN from outside the app?</i></h3>

<p>A: Yes, using shortcuts.  Go to Menu / Add Shortcut to add a shortcut to your home page.
Shortcuts can be created for:</p>

<ul>
<li>connecting a specific profile,</li>
<li>disconnecting, and</li>
<li>launching the app</li>
</ul>

<h3><i>Q: How can I ensure that the VPN stays continuously connected?</i></h3>

<p>A: In the Preferences menu, select the <b>Reconnect on reboot</b> option.
Also, consider setting the <b>Connection Timeout</b> preference to "continuously retry".
If you want to prevent apps from accessing the internet, except through the VPN,
select the <b>Seamless Tunnel</b> preference.</p> 


<h3><i>Q: Why does the VPN disconnect when I make or receive a voice call?</i></h3>

<p>A: Some cellular networks are incapable of maintaining a data connection during a voice
call.  If Android detects this as a loss of network connectivity, the VPN should
enter a pause state during the duration of the call, and automatically resume after
the call is complete.  However if the loss of data connectivity isn't detected by
Android, the VPN connection may time out and disconnect.</p>

<h3><i>Q: Given that mobile devices are easily lost or stolen, how best to secure VPN profiles
against compromise if the device falls into the wrong hands?</i></h3>

<ul>
<li>A: The most sensitive piece of data in a profile is the private key.
Consider removing the client certificate and private key from the profile
and save them in the device Keychain instead (this is discussed below).</li>
<li>Use a strong device-level password.  This is critical to protect data stored in the device
Keychain.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3><i>Q: Is it safe to save passwords?</i></h3>

<p>A: If you check the <b>Save</b> checkbox on the authentication or private key password
fields, the app will store your password in
an encrypted form, however a determined attacker with physical possession of the
device would still be able to recover the password with some reverse engineering.</p>

<p>Currently, the best options for security are to avoid saving passwords,
and to use the Android Keychain as a repository for your private key (see below).</p>

<p>The Android developers are in the process of implementing an API for secure storage
of passwords that will leverage on the hardware-backed keystore and master device
password, however this development is not complete as of Android 4.2.
This approach will protect saved passwords even if the device is rooted.
When this development is complete, we plan to support it in the app.</p>


<h3><i>Q: Why is the save password switch sometimes disabled?</i></h3>

<p>A: The save password switch on the authentication password field is normally enabled,
but can be disabled by the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The following OpenVPN directive, if present in a profile, will disable the password save switch:</p>
<blockquote><tt><b>
setenv ALLOW_PASSWORD_SAVE 0
</b></tt></blockquote>
<p>Note however that the above directive only applies to the authentication password.
The private key password, if it exists, can always be saved.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<h3><i>Q: How to make the app work with profiles that lack a client certificate/key?</i></h3>

<p>A: If you have a profile that connects to a server without a client certificate/key,
you will need to add the following directive to your profile:</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>
setenv CLIENT_CERT 0
</b></tt></blockquote>

<p>This is necessary to resolve an ambiguity when the profile
contains no client certificate or key, because otherwise
the client app can't know whether an external certificate/key
pair should be obtained from the Android Keychain, or whether the
server actually doesn't require a client certificate/key
(for example if the server is configured with the <b>client-cert-not-required</b> directive).
The option is given as a "setenv" to avoid breaking other
OpenVPN clients that might not recognize it.</p>

<h3><i>Q: Why doesn't the app support tap-style tunnels?</i></h3>

<p>A: The Android VPN API supports only tun-style tunnels at the moment.
This is a limitation of the Android platform.  If you try to connect a profile that uses
a tap-based tunnel, you will get an error that only layer 3 tunnels are currently
supported.</p>

<p>If you really want to see tap-style tunnels supported in OpenVPN Connect,
we would encourage you to
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/list">contact the Google Android team</a>
and ask that the VpnService API be extended to allow this.  Without such changes to
the VpnService API, it is not possible for non-root apps such as OpenVPN Connect to support
tap-style tunnels.</p>

<h3><i>Q: Are there any OpenVPN directives not supported by the app?</i></h3>

<p>A: While most OpenVPN client directives are supported by the app, we have made an
effort to reduce bloat and improve maintainability by eliminating what we believe to be obsolete or rarely-used
directives.  Please email us at <a href="mailto:android@openvpn.net">android@openvpn.net</a> if you
believe that a specific directive that is not included should be reconsidered for inclusion.</p>

<p>Here is a partial list of directives not currently supported:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>dev tap</b> &mdash; This directive is not supported because the underlying Android
VPN API doesn't support tap-style tunnels.</li>

<li><b>fragment</b> &mdash; The fragment directive is not supported due to the complexity
it adds to the OpenVPN implementation and the fact that it is usually better to leave
fragmentation up to the lower-level transport protocols.  Note as well that the client
does not support connecting to a server that uses the fragment directive.</li>

<li><b>mssfix</b> &mdash; This directive will be added in a future release.  Since the
functionality of mssfix can be achieved on either the client or server side, specifying
it on the server side will enable it even if the client doesn't support the directive.</li>

<li><b>secret</b> &mdash; Static key encryption mode (non-TLS) is not supported.</li>

<li><b>socks-proxy</b> &mdash; Socks proxy support is currently not supported.</li>

<li>Ciphers other than AES, Blowfish, and DES family &mdash; Currently, only AES, Blowfish,
and DES family ciphers are supported.  This is done to reduce bloat and improve energy efficiency.
The AES cipher algorithm, in particular, is well-suited for the ARM processor
generally used in Android devices.</li>

<li>proxy directives &mdash; While proxy directives are currently supported
(<b>http-proxy</b> and <b>http-proxy-option</b>), they are currently NOT supported in
<b>&lt;connection&gt;</b> profiles.</li>

</ul>

<h3><i>Q: Can I have multiple profiles?</i></h3>

<p>A: Yes, you can import any number of profiles from the Import menu -- tap the profile
field to select one.  Keep in mind that OpenVPN will assign a name to a profile
based on the server that the profile connects to.  If you import a profile
with the same name as one that already exists, the new profile will
replace the old one.  You can prevent this from happening by renaming the
old profile.</p>


<h3><i>Q: How do I delete or rename a profile?</i></h3>

<p>A: Doing a "long touch" on the profile field will bring up a context menu for that
profile that includes delete, rename, etc.</p>

<h3><i>Q: Can I have multiple proxies?</i></h3>

<p>A: Yes, you can add any number of proxies from the main menu.   Once a proxy
is added, a proxy selection field will appear on the main page.  Tap the field
to select a proxy or <b>None</b> at the end of the list to connect directly.</p>

<h3><i>Q: How do I edit or delete a proxy?</i></h3>

<p>A: Doing a "long touch" on the proxy field will bring up a context menu for that
proxy that includes edit, delete, etc.</p>


<h3><i>Q: How do I use a client certificate and private key from the Android Keychain?</i></h3>

<p>A: Using the Android keychain to store your private key has the added security advantage
of leveraging on the hardware-backed
keystores that exist on many Android devices, allowing the key to be protected by the
Android-level device password, and preventing key compromise even if the device
is rooted.</p>

<p>If you already have your client certificate and private key bundled into a PKCS#12
file (extension <b>.p12</b> or <b>.pfx</b>), you can import it into the Android Keychain
using either the Import menu or the Settings app.
</p>


<p>If you don't have a PKCS#12 file, you can convert your certificate and
key files into PKCS#12 form using this <b>openssl</b> command (where <b>cert</b>, <b>key</b>,
and <b>ca</b> are your client certificate, client key, and root CA files).</p>

<blockquote><tt><b>
openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert -inkey key -certfile ca -name MyClient -out client.p12
</b></tt></blockquote>

<p>Then import the <b>client.p12</b> file from the previous step into the app
using the Import / Import PKCS#12 menu option.</p>

<p>Once this is done, remove the
<b>ca</b>, <b>cert</b>, and <b>key</b>
directives from your .ovpn file and re-import it.
When you connect the first time, the app will
ask you to select a certificate to use for the profile.
Just select the <b>MyClient</b>
certificate and you should be able to connect normally.</p>

<h3><i>Q: When I try to import a PKCS#12 file, why am I being asked for a password?</i></h3>

<p>A: When you generate a PKCS#12 file, you will always be asked for an "export
password" to encrypt the file.  This password must again be presented when the
PKCS#12 file is imported into the Android Keychain.  This is to prevent interception
and recovery of the private key during transport.</p>

<h3><i>Q: Why doesn't the PKCS#12 file in my OpenVPN configuration file work the
same as on desktop systems?</i></h3>

<p>PKCS#12 files on Android are used somewhat differently than on
desktop versions of OpenVPN.  In desktop versions, PKCS#12 files can be bundled
or referenced in the OpenVPN profile.  On Android, however, PKCS#12 management is
built into the Android Keychain.  This approach is much better from a security
perspective, because the Keychain can then leverage on hardware features
in the device such as hardware-backed keystores.  However, it does require that
the PKCS#12 file is loaded into the Android Keychain as a separate step from importing
the OpenVPN profile.  It also moves the responsibility for managing PKCS#12 files
to the Android Keychain, and away from OpenVPN, so it can potentially introduce
compatibility issues.</p>

<p>To use a PKCS#12 file on Android, see the FAQ item above: <i>How do I use a client
certificate and private key from the Android Keychain?</i></p>



<h3><i>Q: How do I set up my profile for server failover?</i></h3>

<p>A: You can provide OpenVPN with a list of servers to connect to.  On connection
failure, OpenVPN will rotate through the list until it finds a responsive server.
For example, the following entries in the profile will first try to connect to
server A via UDP port 1194, then TCP port 443, then repeat the process with server B.
OpenVPN will continue to retry until it successfully connects or hits the Connection
Timeout, which can be configured in the Preferences.
</p>

<blockquote><tt>
remote server-a.example.tld 1194 udp<br>
remote server-a.example.tld 443 tcp<br>
remote server-b.example.tld 1194 udp<br>
remote server-b.example.tld 443 tcp<br>
</tt></blockquote>


<h3><i>Q: How can I contact the developers about bugs or feature requests?</i></h3>

<p>A: Send email to <a href="mailto:android@openvpn.net">android@openvpn.net</a>.</p>
